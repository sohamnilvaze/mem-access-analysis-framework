1st column -> Thread ID, Pin thread number
2nd column -> Effective Address, Address of instruction doing memory access
3rd column -> Actual memory address accessed
4th column -> Number of memory operations
5th column -> Access size in bytes, size of memory access


Step 1:- Trace extraction -> C program run under Intel PIN tool to obtain raw trace logs.
Step 2:- trace processing -> extractin only the EA (3rd) column , filter unwanted regions and normalize addresses (both optional), seperate per thread to obtain EA sequence per thread
Step 3:- Feature extraction -> 
    a) Delta computation
    b) Statistical features: mean delta, variance, % of constant deltas, entropy, sign distribution, zero-delta frequency, stride histogram.
Step 4:- Interpretable Modelling layer -> instead of blackbox models use 
    a) Decision trees
    b) rule-based learners: RIPPER, Decision Rule lists, Bayesian Rule lists
    c) Sparse linear models
Step 5:- From trained interpretable models 
    a)Decision trees:- extract decision paths and convert to rule set
    b)Rule lists:- already in rule From
    c)Linear:- derieve threshold boundaries.
Step 6:- Framework output -> instead of just 
    pattern = sequential the output can be 
    Pattern: Sequential

    Decision Explanation:
    - 97% deltas constant
    - Delta variance = 0.0
    - Entropy = 0.03
    - Mean delta = 4

    Rule Triggered:
    IF variance < 0.01 AND entropy < 0.1 → Sequential
